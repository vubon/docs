## Navigating to the Create Cluster page

1. Navigate to the [BigAnimal portal](https://portal.biganimal.com/) (sign in with [your account](../create_account) if need-be)

2. Click the Clusters link on the left to navigate to the [Clusters](https://portal.biganimal.com/clusters) page

3. Click the Create New Cluster button

You should now find yourself at <https://portal.biganimal.com/create-cluster>

## Configuring a new cluster

### The Cluster Settings tab

In the free trial, the range of cluster options is somewhat limited, but should be more than sufficient for demonstrating the capabilities of BigAnimal. 

1. Use **Cluster Name** to describe the purpose of the cluster, e.g. "Test for Advanced Server on AWS"
2. **Password** is the admin password for the cluster - so pick a strong one! Note that this is independent of your EDB account.
3. **Database Type** is one of,

  - - *EnterpriseDB PostgreSQL Advanced Server* for Oracle database compatibility
  - - *PostgreSQL* for official community builds of standard PostgreSQL

    So if you're interested in EDB's enhancements to PostgreSQL for Oracle database compatibility, choose Advanced Server; otherwise, choose PostgreSQL.
4. **Postgres Version** allows you to select from among the supported versions for either database type
4. **Provider** is either AWS or Azure; BigAnimal works the same on either one, so choose the one you're familiar with.
5. **Region** options will depend on which Provider you chose; pick the one closest to you.

For **Instance Type** and **Storage**, only one option is available for each field during the trial - so just choose that.

### The DB Configuration tab

This is entirely optional, but if you're curious you can find a full set of PostgreSQL configuration options on this tab, allowing you to tune a cluster for specific needs or resource constraints.

### The Availability tab

This page configures high availability - but that feature is not available in the trial. Skip this tab unless you're curious.

## Provisioning 

Click create cluster and you'll be brought back to the clusters page with your newly-configured cluster now populating the list.

Initially, the new cluster is being provisioned. This usually takes a minute or two, but can take up to an hour. A progress bar is shown near the right.

Once your first cluster is fully provisioned, your 14 day free trial officially starts, and a countdown will appear telling you how many days are left in your trial.

Click on the provisioned cluster to view the parameters you'll need to connect to it.

## Next steps

Now you have a cluster, you can [connect](../connect_to_a_cluster) to it.
