The BigAnimal Free Trial provides an EDB-hosted environment where you can quickly experience the capabilities that BigAnimal has to offer. 

_or_

EDB offers a 14-day free trial for anyone interested in exploring BigAnimal and its capabilities. The BigAnimal free trial functions like the full-featured BigAnimal so you can get a feel for what to expect. 

## Create an account

If you haven't done so already, you'll need to [create your EDB account](01_create_account). Once you've done that, you can [sign up for the trial](#). The trial period starts only after you create your first cluster.

## Create a cluster

The Free Trial allows anybody to create a database cluster hosted on BigAnimal to try for 14 days. While the trial only allows one cluster to ba active at a time, you are free to delete your cluster and create a new one. It's even possible to any cluster you've previously deleted.

BigAnimal offers both standard PostgreSQL and EnterpriseDB PostgreSQL Advanced Server (EPAS) clusters. You can try out either using the latest PostgreSQL version (14) or one of the previous supported versions (11-13). Other configuration options are limited for the free trail.

There are three ways to create a cluster:

1. [Using the portal](#)
2. [Using the CLI](02_creating_a_cluster/create_cluster_cli)
3. [Using the API](#)

## Connect 

- [Using psql](#)
- [Using pgAdmin](#)

## Experiment

- [Testing backups by restoring a cluster](04_experiment/backup_and_restore)
- [Full PostgreSQL](#)
- [...Plus EDB Postgres Advanced Server's Oracle Compatibility](#)



## What you can do with your free trial
- The free trial lasts for 14 days. The count begins when you provision a cluster. 
- You can provision a single cluster with 2 vCPU and 16 GB RAM in either PostgreSQL or EDB Postgres Advanced Server with up to 4GB of Azure Premium SSD storage. 
- You can choose to provision your cluster in either of 2 Azure Regions: US East 2 or West Europe (Netherlands). 
  - If you delete your cluster within the 14 day trial period, you can restore that cluster or you can provision a new cluster. 
  - Numerous other instance types, storage types, and regions are available with a paid account.
- During the trial, you have access to EDB enterprise-level support.
- You can connect to your database cluster. 
- You can edit the database configuration for a cluster and view the activity log for the service.
- You get an understanding of what account management looks like in BigAnimal.

## What you canâ€™t do
Since this is a free trial, there are a few nuances and limitations to what you can do with a free account:

- You cannot invite team members to join your cluster or assign roles in the free trial. Other team members should create their own free trial account to explore BigAnimal. 
- Backups are only retained for 30 days. 
- The BigAnimal Free Trial interface notes which features are not available in the free trial. No private networking or superuser access is available in the trial. High availability, logging, monitoring, and performance benchmarking are also not available. 

## What happens when the free trial ends 

Within the BigAnimal Free Trial interface, a countdown displays the time remaining for your free trial. 

When the free trial ends, your account continues to exist but your cluster and its backup and data are deleted. You cannot transfer your cluster from the free trial to a paid account. Your free trial account is separate from a paid BigAnimal account.
