The BigAnimal Free Trial provides an EDB-hosted environment where you can quickly experience the features and capabilities of BigAnimal.
The free trial provides a subset of the full-featured BigAnimal environment so that you can get a feel for what to expect. 

## What you get as part of the free trial

- **The latest & greatest PostgreSQL and EDB Postgres Advanced Server databases**. 
  - [PostgreSQL 14](https://www.enterprisedb.com/blog/cool-new-contributions-postgresql-14) is more powerful, more secure, more flexible, more secure and faster than ever ([release notes](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/14/release.html)).
  - [EDB Postgres Advanced Server 14](https://www.enterprisedb.com/docs/epas/latest/epas_rel_notes/) builds on PostgreSQL 14 with a host of features for Oracle database compatibility, security, and usability ([more on Oracle database compatibility](/epas/latest/epas_compat_ora_dev_guide/)).
- **One active cluster, unlimited inactive ones** 
  - You can try different configurations by deleting the active cluster and creating a new one.
  - Restore deleted clusters at any time within the trial period.
  - 2 vCPUs and 16 GB RAM with up to 4GB of Azure Premium SSD storage.
  - 2 Azure Regions to choose from: US East 2 or West Europe (Netherlands). 
- **Edit database configuration settings.**
- **Connect to your cluster** via a public IP from psql, pgAdmin, or your favorite PostgreSQL-friendly application.
- **Access to EDB enterprise-level support.**
- **Use BigAnimal services for 14 days.** The countdown begins when you first provision a cluster. 

(Numerous other instance types, storage types, regions, customizations and support options are available with a paid account.)

Get started with your trial by signing up for a free EDB account.

## Create an account

If you haven't done so already, you'll need to [create your EDB account](01_create_account). Once you've done that, you can [sign up for the trial](#). 

Registering an account on enterprisedb.com gets you access to the BigAnimal trial, as well as EDB's training and software downloads. 
Accounts are free, and registration takes less than a minute.

## Create a cluster

The Free Trial allows anybody to create a database cluster hosted on BigAnimal to try for 14 days. While the trial only allows one cluster to ba active at a time, you are free to delete your cluster and create a new one. It's even possible to restore any cluster you've previously deleted.

BigAnimal offers both standard PostgreSQL and EnterpriseDB PostgreSQL Advanced Server (EPAS) clusters. You can try out either using the latest PostgreSQL version (14) or one of the previous supported versions (11-13). Other configuration options are limited for the free trail.

There are several equivalent ways to create a cluster...

- [...Using the portal](#)
- [...Using the CLI](02_creating_a_cluster/create_cluster_cli)
- [...Using the API](#)

## Connect 

Once you have a running cluster, you can connect using any PostgreSQL compatible software - here are a few ideas to get you going:

- [Using psql](#)
- [Using pgAdmin](#)
- [Using VSCode](#)

## Experiment

A database is always more interesting when it contains... Data! 
Load up some sample data and see what BigAnimal lets you do with it:

- [Testing backups by restoring a cluster](04_experiment/backup_and_restore)
- [Full PostgreSQL](#)
- [...Plus EDB Postgres Advanced Server's Oracle Compatibility](#)

## What you canâ€™t do
Since this is a free trial, there are a few nuances and limitations to what you can do with a free account:

- You cannot invite team members to join your cluster or assign roles in the free trial. Other team members should create their own free trial account to explore BigAnimal. 
- Backups are only retained for 30 days. 
- The BigAnimal Free Trial interface notes which features are not available in the free trial. No private networking or superuser access is available in the trial. High availability, logging, monitoring, and performance benchmarking are also not available. 

## What happens when the free trial ends 

Within the BigAnimal Free Trial interface, a countdown displays the time remaining for your free trial. 

When the free trial ends, your account continues to exist but your cluster and its backup and data are deleted. You cannot transfer your cluster from the free trial to a paid account. Your free trial account is separate from a paid BigAnimal account. 

We hope two weeks is enough to give you a rough idea of what BigAnimal offers, but if you're interested in *really* seeing it in action we also offer a 30-day trial of the full product, running on your own Azure account with full access to all regions and configurations.
