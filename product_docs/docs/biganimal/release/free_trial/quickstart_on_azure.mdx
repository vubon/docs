## Step 1: create an account and sign into the portal

If you haven't done so already, you'll need to [create your EDB account](create_an_account). 

Then, use your account to access the [BigAnimal portal](https://portal.biganimal.com/).

## Step 2: create an Azure cluster 

1. Click the Clusters link on the left to navigate to the [Clusters](https://portal.biganimal.com/clusters) page

2. Click the Create New Cluster button

    You should now find yourself at <https://portal.biganimal.com/create-cluster>

3. Enter "AWS PostgreSQL cluster" in the **Cluster Name** field
4. Enter a strong, memorable password in the **Password** field
   This is the admin password for the cluster.
5. Choose "EnterpriseDB Postgres Advanced Server (EPAS)" for **Database Type**
   This gives you EDB's Oracle database compatible version of Postgres
6. Choose "14" for **Postgres Version**
4. Select Azure for **Provider**
5. Select "(US) East US 2" for **Region**
6. For **Instance Type** and **Storage**, only one set of options are available in the trial - select them.
7. Click "Create Cluster"

### Provisioning, active clusters and deletion

Click create cluster and you'll be brought back to the clusters page with your newly-configured cluster now populating the list.

Initially, the new cluster is being provisioned. This usually takes a minute or two, but can take up to an hour. A progress bar is shown near the right.

Once your first cluster is fully provisioned, your 14 day free trial officially starts, and a countdown will appear telling you how many days are left in your trial.

## Step 3: Connecting to your new cluster

1. Click on your cluster to get an overview of how it has been configured. Select the **Connect** tab to see more information about how to connect to your cluster.
2. Select the **Overview** tab and copy the **Quick Connect** command. Paste it into a terminal where `psql` is installed. It will prompt for your password and put you on a SQL command line.

   ```
   $ psql -W "postgres://edb_admin@[HOST]:5432/edb_admin?sslmode=require"
   Password:
   psql (13.5 (Ubuntu 13.5-2.pgdg20.04+1), server 14.2.1 (Debian 14.2.1-1+deb10))
   WARNING: psql major version 13, server major version 14.
            Some psql features might not work.
   SSL connection (protocol: TLSv1.3, cipher: TLS_AES_256_GCM_SHA384, bits: 256, compression: off)
   Type "help" for help.

   edb_admin=>
   ```

!!! Note
  While psql is a good all-around option for working with Postgres databases, you can use the client of your choice - see [Connect to a cluster](connect_to_a_cluster) for more ideas.

## Step 4: Import a database and try some Oracle-syntax queries

You can find a full walkthrough in the [Oracle SQL compatibility demo](../using_cluster/06_demonstration_oracle_compatibility#try-it-on-your-own-cluster-export-and-import).

You've successfully created a BigAnimal free trial cluster. If you want to explore other configurations, feel free to delete your cluster and create a new one. During the free trial, all clusters are automatically backed-up and can be restored any time before the end of the trial period.
