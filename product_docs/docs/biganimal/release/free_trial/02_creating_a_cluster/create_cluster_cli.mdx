We'll be using the [BigAnimal command line interface](/biganimal/latest/reference/cli/), which is a convenient wrapper to the [BigAnimal API](/biganimal/latest/reference/api/). To start, download [the latest binary](/biganimal/latest/reference/cli/) and move it to wherever you system will find executable files. If you have a Unix-style shell, your own `bin` directory is usually a good location.
```shell
mv biganimal $HOME/bin
```

It may also be necessary to give the executable proper permission:
```shell
chmod +x $HOME/bin/biganimal
```


Next, we need to create a credential on BigAnimal. You can pick any username you prefer.
```shell
biganimal create-credential -a portal.biganimal.com -o 443 -n newuser
```

The command will direct you to open a webpage and copy the randomly-generated, one-time code. You’ll need to log in (or already be logged in) to activate the credentials. You can see which credentials you have verified on the command line.

```shell
biganimal show-credentials
```

!!! caution
If you add another credential, you’ll need to add `--credential [newuser]` to the following commands. If you only have one, the option is not needed. You may remove unneeded credentials using `biganimal delete-credential [olduser]`. Most users will not need to add multiple credentials.
!!!

In the free trial, the range of cluster options is somewhat limited, but should be more than sufficient for demonstrating the capabilities of BigAnimal.

Pick the region closest to you from the list provided by biganimal:
```shell
biganimal show-regions
```

Other options can be queried via the CLI, but the only variable we need to set for this demo is .

Edit a new file called create_cluster.yaml:
```yaml
---
clusterName: test_cluster # Pick a more meaningful name!
password: mygoodpassword  # Please change this password!
postgresType: epas
postgresVersion: "14"
provider: azure
region: eastus2  # Select from the options given by show-regions
instanceType: azure:Standard_E2s_v3
volumeProperties: P1
volumeType: azurepremiumstorage
networking: public
highAvailability: false
---
```

Use the config file to create a new cluster:
```shell
biganimal create-cluster --clusterConfigFile create_cluster.yaml
```

If successful, the command will give you a command to check the status of your new cluster:
```shell
biganimal show-clusters --id p-xxxxxxxxxx
```

The id will be used to manage your cluster. It might take a few minutes to create your cluster. When it’s ready, you can get the connection string for your cluster:
```shell
biganimal show-cluster-connection --id p-xxxxxxxxxxx
```

Once the cluster is created, log in via psql. Use the password from the config file for edb_admin.
```shell
psql 'postgres://edb_admin@p-xxxxxxxxxx.pg.biganimal.io:5432/edb_admin?sslmode=require'
```
