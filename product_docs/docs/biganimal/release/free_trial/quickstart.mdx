This topic provides a quick walkthrough of the steps needed to configure a PostgreSQL cluster on BigAnimal running against AWS with a free trial account. 

## Step 1: create an account and sign into the portal

If you haven't done so already, you'll need to [create your EDB account](create_an_account). 

Then, use your account to access the [BigAnimal portal](https://portal.biganimal.com/).

## Step 2: create an AWS cluster 

1. Select the Clusters link on the left to navigate to the [Clusters](https://portal.biganimal.com/clusters) page

2. Select the Create New Cluster button

    You should now find yourself at <https://portal.biganimal.com/create-cluster>

3. Enter "AWS PostgreSQL cluster" in the **Cluster Name** field
4. Enter a strong, memorable password in the **Password** field
   This is the admin password for the cluster.
5. Choose "PostgreSQL" for **Database Type**
   This gives you an official build of PostgreSQL
6. Choose "14" for **Postgres Version**
4. Select AWS for **Provider**
5. Select "US East 1" for **Region**
6. For **Instance Type** and **Storage**, only one set of options are available in the trial - select them.
7. Select "Create Cluster"

### Provisioning, active clusters and deletion

Select create cluster and you'll be brought back to the clusters page with your newly-configured cluster now populating the list.

Initially, the new cluster is being provisioned. This usually takes a minute or two, but can take up to an hour. A progress bar is shown near the right.

Once your first cluster is fully provisioned, your 14 day free trial officially starts, and a countdown will appear telling you how many days are left in your trial.

## Step 3: Connecting to your new cluster

1. Select your cluster to get an overview of how it has been configured. Select the **Connect** tab to see more information about how to connect to your cluster.
2. Select the **Overview** tab and copy the **Quick Connect** command. Paste it into a terminal where `psql` is installed. It will prompt for your password and put you on a SQL command line.

   ```
   $ psql -W "postgres://edb_admin@[HOST]:5432/edb_admin?sslmode=require"
   Password:
   psql (13.5 (Ubuntu 13.5-2.pgdg20.04+1), server 14.2.1 (Debian 14.2.1-1+deb10))
   WARNING: psql major version 13, server major version 14.
            Some psql features might not work.
   SSL connection (protocol: TLSv1.3, cipher: TLS_AES_256_GCM_SHA384, bits: 256, compression: off)
   Type "help" for help.

   edb_admin=>
   ```

!!! Note
    While psql is a good all-around option for working with Postgres databases, you can use the client of your choice - see [Connect to a cluster](connect_to_a_cluster) for more ideas.


## Things to try

### Create a new database

We're going to create some sample math data, so we're going to create a database called `math`. We _could_ use the default `edb_admin` database, but best practice is to isolate data.

1. Create a new role called `math`.

   ```
   create user math with password 'math_password';
   ```

2. Grant the `math` role to `edb_admin`.

   ```
   grant math to edb_admin;
   ```

3. Create a new `math` database.

   ```
   create database math with owner math;
   ```

4. Connect to the `math` database. You will be prompted for the `edb_admin` password you provided in Step 2 above.

   ```
   \connect math
   ```


### Populate a table and query it

We're going to use temporary tables to calculate prime numbers using a [Sieve of Eratosthenes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sieve_of_Eratosthenes).

1. Create a table for storing prime numbers called `primes`.

   ```sql
   CREATE TABLE primes (
     num INTEGER,
     PRIMARY KEY (num)
   );
   ```

2. Populate the table with all prime numbers up to 1000. (This code is based on [code from David Fetter](https://wiki.postgresql.org/wiki/Sieve_of_Eratosthenes).)

   ```sql
   -- Based on https://wiki.postgresql.org/wiki/Sieve_of_Eratosthenes
   
   WITH RECURSIVE
   t0(m) AS (
       VALUES(1000)
   ),
   t1(n) AS (
       VALUES(2)
   UNION ALL
       SELECT n+1 FROM t1 WHERE n < (SELECT m FROM t0)
   ),
   t2 (n, i) AS (
       SELECT 2*n, 2
       FROM t1 WHERE 2*n <= (SELECT m FROM t0)
   UNION ALL
       (
           WITH t3(k) AS (
               SELECT max(i) OVER () + 1 FROM t2
           ),
           t4(k) AS (
               SELECT DISTINCT k FROM t3
           )
           SELECT k*n, k
           FROM
               t1
           CROSS JOIN
               t4
           WHERE k*k <= (SELECT m FROM t0)
       )
   )
   INSERT INTO primes (
     SELECT n FROM t1 EXCEPT
     SELECT n FROM t2
     ORDER BY 1
   );
   ```

3. Select the largest prime number less than 1000.

   ```
   SELECT max(num)
   FROM primes
   WHERE num < 1000;
   ```

You've successfully created a BigAnimal free trial cluster. If you want to explore other configurations, feel free to delete your cluster and create a new one. During the free trial, all clusters are automatically backed-up and can be restored any time before the end of the trial period.
