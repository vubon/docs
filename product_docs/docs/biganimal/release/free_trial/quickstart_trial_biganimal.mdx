This page shows you how to create a PostgreSQL or EDB Postgres Advanced Server cluster using BigAnimal (free for 14 days), connect to the cluster, populate sample data, and run some queries.

## Step 1. Create a free trial cluster

We will create an [EDB Postgres Advanced Server](/docs/epas/latest/) (EPAS) cluster based on the latest PostgreSQL release. It will be hosted on AWS.

1. If you haven't done so already, [create your EDB account](https://62312143bb9e32503f5ac560--edb-docs-staging.netlify.app/docs/biganimal/latest/free_trial/01_create_account/).

2. Sign up for a free trial of BigAnimal.

3. Navigate to the [Create Cluster](https://portal.biganimal.com/create-cluster) page.

4. Enter a name for your cluster in the **Cluster Name** field. (

5. Pick a secure **Password** for your cluster.

6. Select `EnterpriseDB PostgreSQL Advanced Server (EPAS)` as your **Database Type**.

7. For **Postgres Version**, use `14` for the most advanced features.

8. Select `AWS` for the **Provider**.

9. Pick the **Region** nearest you.

10. Under **Instance Series** pick `AWS EC2 R5 Instances`.

11. Use `r5.large, 2vCPU, 16GB RAM` for the **Size**.

12. Leave all other options on their default.

13. Push the **Create Cluster** button to create your cluster.

It takes about 5 minutes for the cluster to be spun up. While you are waiting, watch [a video about setting up a connection].

## Step 2. Connect to your cluster

1. Click on your cluster to get an overview of how it has been configured. Select the **Connect** tab to see more information about how to connect to your cluster.
2. Select the **Overview** tab and copy the **Quick Connect** command. Paste it into a terminal where `psql` is installed. It will prompt for your password and put you on a SQL command line.

   ```
   $ psql -W "postgres://edb_admin@[HOST]:5432/edb_admin?sslmode=require"
   Password:
   psql (13.5 (Ubuntu 13.5-2.pgdg20.04+1), server 14.2.1 (Debian 14.2.1-1+deb10))
   WARNING: psql major version 13, server major version 14.
            Some psql features might not work.
   SSL connection (protocol: TLSv1.3, cipher: TLS_AES_256_GCM_SHA384, bits: 256, compression: off)
   Type "help" for help.

   edb_admin=>
   ```

## Step 3. Create a new database (optional)

We're going to create some sample math data, so we're going to create a database called `math`. We _could_ use the default `edb_admin` database, but best practice is to isolate data.

1. Create a new role called `math`.

   ```
   create user math with password 'math_password';
   ```

2. Grant the `math` role to `edb_admin`.

   ```
   grant math to edb_admin;
   ```

3. Create a new `math` database.

   ```
   create database math with owner math;
   ```

4. Connect to the `math` database.

   ```
   create database math with owner math;
   ```

## Step 4. Populate sample data

We're going to use temporary tables to calculate prime numbers using a Sieve of Eratosthenes.

1. Create a table for storing prime numbers called `primes`.

   ```sql
   CREATE TABLE primes (
     num INTEGER,
     PRIMARY KEY (num)
   );
   ```

2. Populate the table with all prime numbers up to 1000. (This code is based on [code from David Fetter](https://wiki.postgresql.org/wiki/Sieve_of_Eratosthenes).)

   ```sql
   -- Based on https://wiki.postgresql.org/wiki/Sieve_of_Eratosthenes
   
   WITH RECURSIVE
   t0(m) AS (
       VALUES(1000)
   ),
   t1(n) AS (
       VALUES(2)
   UNION ALL
       SELECT n+1 FROM t1 WHERE n < (SELECT m FROM t0)
   ),
   t2 (n, i) AS (
       SELECT 2*n, 2
       FROM t1 WHERE 2*n <= (SELECT m FROM t0)
   UNION ALL
       (
           WITH t3(k) AS (
               SELECT max(i) OVER () + 1 FROM t2
           ),
           t4(k) AS (
               SELECT DISTINCT k FROM t3
           )
           SELECT k*n, k
           FROM
               t1
           CROSS JOIN
               t4
           WHERE k*k <= (SELECT m FROM t0)
       )
   )
   INSERT INTO primes (
     SELECT n FROM t1 EXCEPT
     SELECT n FROM t2
     ORDER BY 1
   );
   ```

3. Select the largest prime number less than 1000.

   ```
   SELECT max(num)
   FROM primes
   WHERE num < 1000;
   ```

You've successfully created a BigAnimal free trial cluster. If you want to explore other configurations, feel free to delete your cluster and create a new one. During the free trial, all clusters are automatically backed-up and can be restored any time before the end of the trial period.
