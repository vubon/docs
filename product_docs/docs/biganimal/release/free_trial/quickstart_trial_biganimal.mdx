This page shows you how to create a PostgreSQL or EDB Postgres Advanced Server cluster using BigAnimal (free for 14 days), connect to the cluster, import sample data, and run some queries.

## Step 1. Create a free trial cluster

We will create an [EDB Postgres Advanced Server](/docs/epas/latest/) (EPAS) cluster based on the latest PostgreSQL release. It will be hosted on [ideally AWS, but for the moment I'm using] Azure.

1. If you haven't done so already, [create your EDB account](https://62312143bb9e32503f5ac560--edb-docs-staging.netlify.app/docs/biganimal/latest/free_trial/01_create_account/).

2. Sign up for a free trial of BigAnimal.

3. Navigate to the [Create Cluster](https://portal.biganimal.com/create-cluster) page.

4. Enter a name for your cluster in the **Cluster Name** field.

5. Pick a secure **Password** for your cluster.

6. Select `EnterpriseDB PostgreSQL Advanced Server (EPAS)` as your **Database Type**.

7. For **Postgres Version**, use `14` for the most advanced features.

8. Select [AWS, whe that's possible, but for now] `Microsoft Azure` for the **Provider**.

9. Pick the **Region** nearest you.

10. Under **Instance Series** pick [whatever makes sense for AWS or] `Standard DSv3 Family vCPUs`.

11. Use [AWS option or] `D2s v3 (2vCPU, 8GB RAM)` for the **Size**.

12. Select [whatever AWS needs or] `P1 (4 Gi, 120 Provisioned IOPS, 25 Provisioned MB/s)` for the cluster's **Volume Properies**.

13. Push the **Create Cluster** button to create your cluster.

It takes about 5 minutes for the cluster to be spun up. While you are waiting, watch [a video about setting up a connection].

## Step 2. Connect to your cluster

[Index of the top N ways to connect to a cluster.]

* Command line using `psql`
* pgAdmin
* VSCode
* DBeaver
* Other?

[Maybe stop here?]

## Step 3. Create a new database (optional)

We're going to create some sample math data, so we're going to create a database called `math`. We _could_ use the default `edb_admin` database, but best practice is to isolate data.

[For each of the ways to connect, link to the documentation about how to create a new database.]

## Step 4. Populate sample data

We're going to use temporary tables to calculate prime numbers usings a Sieve of Eratosthenes. First we need to create a table of primes.


```sql
CREATE TABLE primes (
  num INTEGER,
  PRIMARY KEY (num)
);
```

[Turns out to be kinda a lot of complicated SQL. Probably better to use a simplier example. I wanted to import data, but that very much depends on the way the user connects. pgAdmin can't use the COPY command without jumping through some hoops, for instance.]

```sql
-- Based on https://wiki.postgresql.org/wiki/Sieve_of_Eratosthenes

WITH RECURSIVE
t0(m) AS (
    VALUES(1000)
),
t1(n) AS (
    VALUES(2)
UNION ALL
    SELECT n+1 FROM t1 WHERE n < (SELECT m FROM t0)
),
t2 (n, i) AS (
    SELECT 2*n, 2
    FROM t1 WHERE 2*n <= (SELECT m FROM t0)
UNION ALL
    (
        WITH t3(k) AS (
            SELECT max(i) OVER () + 1 FROM t2
        ),
        t4(k) AS (
            SELECT DISTINCT k FROM t3
        )
        SELECT k*n, k
        FROM
            t1
        CROSS JOIN
            t4
        WHERE k*k <= (SELECT m FROM t0)
    )
)
INSERT INTO primes (
  SELECT n FROM t1 EXCEPT
  SELECT n FROM t2
  ORDER BY 1
);
```
