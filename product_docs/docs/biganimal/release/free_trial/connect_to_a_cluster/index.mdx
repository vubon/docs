So, you've created a cluster... Now what? You probably want to connect to it!

BigAnimal clusters are Real Actual Postgres Databases, so you can connect to them just as you would any other Postgres database. Here are a few examples:

## Connect using psql

[psql](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/app-psql.html) is the standard PostgreSQL [REPL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Read%E2%80%93eval%E2%80%93print_loop) 
and an all-around useful tool for working with PostgreSQL databases. In addition to letting you submit SQL and view the results, there are quite a few commands for
inspecting and managing the database built in that make light work of even complex tasks.

You can find an example of connecting to a BigAnimal cluster via psql right on your cluster's Overview tab on the portal. e.g.

```shell
psql -W "postgres://edb_admin@p-xj6qj8i1hx.qsbilba3hlgp1vqr.biganimal.io:5432/edb_admin?sslmode=require"
```

The URI is all that's necessary for psql; while you *can* pass each element of that URL individually 
(pulling the information from the Connect tab on the portal for instance), psql will happily parse it out for you (and prompt for the password).

In case you're unfamiliar with PostgreSQL's URI format, you can find it documented [on postgresql.org](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/libpq-connect.html#id-1.7.3.8.3.6).


!!! EDB Postgres Advanced Server enhancements
    If your cluster is running EDB Postgres Advanced Server, you might wish to install the version of psql that ships with it - there are a few nice additions such as
tab completion for Oracle database compatible syntax. However, the standard PostgreSQL client will work with Advanced Server as well.

## Connect using pgAdmin

Prefer using a GUI to work with your cluster? [The pgAdmin project](https://www.pgadmin.org/download/) provides just that: inspect, monitor, manage and query your cluster's databases from a desktop or web UI. 

A quick way to try out pgAdmin is to run it in a Docker container. With Docker installed, run:

```shell
docker run -p 8000:80 \
    -e 'PGADMIN_DEFAULT_EMAIL=user@example.com' \
    -e 'PGADMIN_DEFAULT_PASSWORD=password' \
    -d dpage/pgadmin4

```

Once the command finishes, you can open the pgAdmin dashboard by visiting http://localhost:8000/ then entering the email and password specified on the command line.

From the welcome page, select Add New Server. You'll be prompted to configure the connection:

Enter "BigAnimal Trial" for the name (or use the name you gave to your cluster!), then click "Connection"

[screenshot]

1. Enter your cluster's hostname in the Host name/address field, 
2. `edb_admin` in the Maintenance database field (this is the default database that'll be connected to by pgAdmin), 
3. `edb_admin` in the Username field,
4. and the password you provided when configuring your cluster in the Password field (you may want to save this for convenience while testing).

Click SSL and change SSL mode to "Require".

Finally, click the "Save" button. pgAdmin will try to establish a connection to your database, and when successful will display the dashboard 
along with the list of available databases on the left.
