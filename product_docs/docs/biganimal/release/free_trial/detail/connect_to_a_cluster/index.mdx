So, you've created a cluster... Now what? You probably want to connect to it!

BigAnimal clusters are Real Actual Postgres Databases, so you can connect to them just as you would any other Postgres database. 

All of the parameters you need to connect can be found on the portal by selecting the name of your cluster on the [Clusters](https://portal.biganimal.com/clusters) page, then selecting the **Connect** tab.

This section provides a few examples of connecting from common clients.
