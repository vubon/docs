!!! Note
    All of the parameters you need to connect can be found on the portal by selecting the name of your cluster on the [Clusters](https://portal.biganimal.com/clusters) page, then selecting the **Connect** tab.


[The pgAdmin project](https://www.pgadmin.org/download/) allows you to inspect, monitor, manage, and query your cluster's databases from a desktop or web UI. 

A quick way to try out pgAdmin is to run it in a Docker container. With Docker installed, run:

```shell
docker run -p 8000:80 \
    -e 'PGADMIN_DEFAULT_EMAIL=user@example.com' \
    -e 'PGADMIN_DEFAULT_PASSWORD=password' \
    -d dpage/pgadmin4

```

Once the command finishes, you can open the pgAdmin dashboard by visiting http://localhost:8000/ then entering the email and password specified on the command line.

From the welcome page, select **Add New Server**. You're prompted to configure the connection:

Enter "BigAnimal Trial" for the name (or use the name you gave to your cluster!), then select **Connection**.

1. Enter your cluster's hostname in the **Host name/address** field, 
2. "edb_admin" in the **Maintenance database** field (this is the default database that'll be connected to by pgAdmin), 
3. "edb_admin" in the **Username** field,
4. and the password you provided when configuring your cluster in the **Password** field (you may want to save this for convenience while testing).

Select SSL and change SSL mode to "Require".

Finally, select the **Save** button. pgAdmin tries to establish a connection to your database, and when successful displays the dashboard 
along with the list of available databases on the left.
