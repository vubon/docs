## Navigating to the Create Cluster page

1. Navigate to the [BigAnimal portal](https://portal.biganimal.com/) (sign in with [your account](../create_account) if need-be).

2. Select the **Clusters** link on the left to navigate to the [Clusters](https://portal.biganimal.com/clusters) page.

3. Select the **Create New Cluster** button.

You should now find yourself at <https://portal.biganimal.com/create-cluster>.

## Configuring a new cluster

### The Cluster Settings tab

In the free trial, the range of cluster options is somewhat limited, but should be more than sufficient for demonstrating the capabilities of BigAnimal. 

1. Use **Cluster Name** to describe the purpose of the cluster, e.g. "Test for Advanced Server on AWS."
2. **Password** is the admin password for the cluster - so pick a strong one! Note that this is independent of your EDB account.
3. **Database Type** is one of,

   - *EnterpriseDB PostgreSQL Advanced Server* for Oracle database compatibility
   - *PostgreSQL* for official community builds of standard PostgreSQL

    So if you're interested in EDB's enhancements to PostgreSQL for Oracle database compatibility, choose Advanced Server; otherwise, choose PostgreSQL.
4. **Postgres Version** allows you to select from among the supported versions for either database type.
4. **Provider** is either AWS or Azure; BigAnimal works the same on either one, so choose the one you're familiar with.
5. **Region** options depend on which Provider you chose; pick the one closest to you.
6. **Network Connectivity** is restricted to a public IP for the trial, but you can restrict access to trusted networks by
   checking the **Use allowlists to restrict network access** checkbox and specifying one more more [CIDR blocks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classless_Inter-Domain_Routing) 
   to allow access from.

For **Instance Type** and **Storage**, only one option is available for each field during the trial - so just choose that.

### The DB Configuration tab

This is entirely optional, but if you're curious you can find a full set of PostgreSQL configuration options on this tab, allowing you to tune a cluster for specific needs or resource constraints.

### The Availability tab

This page configures high availability - but that feature is not available in the trial. Skip this tab unless you're curious.

## Provisioning 

Select create cluster and you're brought back to the clusters page with your newly-configured cluster now populating the list.

Initially, the new cluster is being provisioned. This usually takes a minute or two, but can take up to an hour. A progress bar is shown near the right.

Once your first cluster is fully provisioned, your 14 day free trial officially starts, and a countdown appears telling you how many days are left in your trial.

Select the provisioned cluster to view the parameters you'll need to connect to it.
