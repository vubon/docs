The BigAnimal Free Trial allows one active cluster. If you want to try another configuration, you'll need to delete your active cluster. Thankfully it's quick and easy to [restore a cluster from backup](../experiment/backup_and_restore/). Backups are automatically created as soon as a cluster is used.

When you create a cluster, there are two flavors of PostgreSQL to choice from:

* All supported versions of [open-source PostgreSQL](supported-open-source/postgresql/), including [PostgreSQL 14](https://www.postgresql.org/about/news/postgresql-14-released-2318/).
* [EDB Postgres Advanced Server](/epas/latest/), which augments open-source PostgreSQL with [Oracle compatibilty](/epas/latest/epas_compat_ora_dev_guide/) among other features.

We'll demonstate two methods of creating a cluster:

* [Using the portal](create_cluster_portal)
* [Using the command line](create_cluster_cli)

Clusters may also be created programatically using the [fully-featured BigAnimal API](/biganimal/latest/reference/api/).
