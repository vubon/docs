| Type        | Description |
| ----------- |------------ |
| Enhancement |  Replication Server is certified to support PostgreSQL v14 and EDB Postgres Advanced Server v14. |
| Enhancement | Performance optimization for Synchronize operation when a MMR Publication has a SMR Subscription. [Support Ticket #74217]  |
| Bug Fix | The `removepub` CLI command removes a Publication while it has one or more Subscriptions. This issue is fixed. [Support Ticket #72194] |
| Bug Fix | Fixed an issue where replication fails for the `UUID` data type in EDB Postgres Advanced Server to MS SQL Server permutation.  [Support Ticket #73835] |
| Bug Fix | Fixed an issue where the Synchronize operation failed to replicate NULL for a BLOB type for EDB Postgres Advanced Server to Oracle. [Support Ticket #74057] |
| Bug Fix | Fixed case where wrong schema qualifier was picked up during history cleanup for EDB Postgres Advanced Server to Oracle and SQL Server permutations. [Support Ticket #72626] |
| Bug Fix | Fixed loading of Replication History on Replication Console after restart of Publication Services when SMR subscription is associated with a MMR Publication. [Support Ticket #74217] |
| Bug Fix | Fixed the upgrade issue related with the enhancement of shadow table triggers. [Support Ticket #74447] |
| Bug Fix | Fixed an issue where redundant INSERT conflicts were recorded when a new table was added in the MMR Publication. |
| Bug Fix | In a hybrid replication cluster, the cleanup shadow table routine is subject to remove unprocessed changes. This issue is fixed. |
| Bug Fix | The Synchronize replication fails while replicating changes for a multi-level List Partition table. This issue is fixed. |
| Bug Fix | Fixed the error where Snapshot fails for the third database in a MMR cluster. |
| Bug Fix | Fixed an error that prevented creation of a row-level Filter based on the `->` operator for JSONB data type. |
| Bug Fix | Fixed the issue related with the reporting of incorrect missing privileges while registering Oracle Publication database. |
| Bug Fix | In a hybrid cluster, batch is always applied using BUS (batch update using simple Statement) mode even when the user has opted for BUP mode (batch update using PreparedStatement).  This issue is now fixed. |
| Bug Fix | Fixed an issue where an INSERT conflict in MMR Publication is subject to failure of Synchronize operation for a target SMR Subscription in a hybrid cluster. [Support Ticket #75608]|
| Bug Fix | Fixed an issue so that a validation  error is reported when the CLI command `createpub` is executed without registering a Publication database. |
| Bug Fix | Fixed the NoClassDefFoundError error (org/postgresql/replication/LogSequenceNumber) observed during data Snapshot operation for a RPM based installation on RHEL8/CENTOS8. |
| Bug Fix | Fixed the error `libpq JNI wrapper library is not available` that occured while adding a database for WAL based replication.
